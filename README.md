# yunabot
Source code from our funniest bot @OvelhaInflavel Telegram Group

01. Create your bot with @TheBotFather

02. Invite your bot to your group/channel/superchannel

03. Invite @RawDataBot to your group/channel/superchannel

04. In order to put your bot to access all the incoming messages in a group/channel/superchannel you need to set its PRIVACY to DISABLED in your chat with @TheBotFather:
- /setprivacy
- botname
- disabled
- done!

05. If you have Python installed you can skip this step:
- go to https://www.python.org/downloads/ and choose your version (I would recommend v3.7.2 - just sayin')

06. Go on and update pip:
- pip install --upgdate pip

07. If you have Telethon installed(which I doubt) you can update it now or skip this step if you will:
- pip install --update telethon

08. Install other packages used in the code:
- pip install --update requests BeautifulSoup4

09. Copy and edit the yunabot.py file
- change the api_id value
- change the api_hash value
- change the yuna_token value
- change the yuna_name value
- change the group_id value

10. Run the bot
- go to the yunabot.py's folder
- type "python yunabot.py" on terminal or double-click it if you're a Windows user
